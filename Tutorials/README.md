# How to build Android audio effect from scratch?

## Example - JamesDSP Engine frame
Compatibility: Support all Android version from 4.4(Kitkat) to 10.0(Q)

Any signal processing code is not present.

Android audio framework learner that use current repository can play around it and add your own DSP code. I'm pretty sure this repository is a good starting point, you can build your own audio effect engine without download the whole Android source code from Google, while I can't deny AOSP Android code is very useful at reference, but not very useful at program design.
